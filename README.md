# project-4-group-11
Grouup 11 Capstone Project
The project explored "Black Money" data. We attempted to answer the following questions:
  1- Are there particular countries more prone to be involved in illicid monitery activities.
  2- What thresholds might constitute possible illegal activities.
  3- Are there transaction types that indicate illegal activities.
The data set is an interesting starting point into the subject. However, due to limitations such as missing data and the fact that some of the data are reports of suspicious activity (not confirmed) high confidence in the results is not possible.
A call to action would be to obtain additional data sets with higher quality and do further analysis.
